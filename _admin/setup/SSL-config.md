ThoughtSpot enables you to use SSL (secure socket layers) for sending data to and from ThoughtSpot. SSL provides authentication and data security. This section applies to both SSL to enable secure HTTP and secure LDAP.

## About SSL
Many IT departments require SSL for their applications that access data. To use SSL with ThoughtSpot, you must have your company's own SSL certificate. The certificate is issued per domain (service), so if you want to use SSL for both HTTP(S) and LDAP(S), you need two separate certificates - one for the HTTPS domain and one for the LDAPS domain.

If you do not have an SSL certificate:

-   Check with your IT department to see if they already have an SSL certificate you can use.
-   If not, you must obtain the certificate from an issuing authority.
-   Alternatively, you may disable SSL if you don't want the security it provides by using the command `tscli ssl off`.

There are many SSL vendors to choose from. Check with your existing Web hosting provider first, to see if they can provide the certificate for you.

When you apply for the SSL certificate, you may specify a SAN, wildcard, or single domain certificate. Any of these can work with ThoughtSpot.

## Configure SSL for web traffic

This procedure shows how to add SSL (secure socket layers) to enable secure HTTP (HTTPS) in ThoughtSpot. To set up SSL, you need:

-   The SSL certificate chain in .PEM format. This format has X.509v3 file containing ASCII (Base64) armored data packed between a â€œBEGIN" and "END" directive. It can be a bundle of certificates.
-   The private key in compatible .PEM format. It should not be password/passphrase protected.

**_NOTE:_** Do not use a passphrase while creating the cert. Invoke the command, `openssl rsa -check -in pk.key` to verify if you're prompted to specify a passphrase. If yes, then you need to remove the passphrase to use the key.

### Using Management Console
To install and configure the SSL certificate using the admin UI:

1. Log into ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click the **Admin** icon on the top navigation bar.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin.png)

   This opens the ThoughtSpot Management Console.
3. Click **Settings** icon on the top navigation bar.
4. In the Settings panel, click **SSL** and then  **Configure** option.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings-ssl.png)  

5. Enter the SSL details:

   <col width="80%" />
   </colgroup>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>SSL Status</th>
      <td>Enable the SSL. If you want to disable the LDAP configuration, select Disable and exit the setup.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Algorithm</th>
      <td>Choose the algorithm as RSA.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Minimum TLS Version</th>
      <td>Set the recommended TLS version as TLS v1.2. <p><b>Note</b>: Choose SSL v3, TLS v1.0, and TLS v1.1 for backwards compatibility.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Private Key</th>
      <td>Browse and copy the private key to ThoughtSpot.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Public Certificate</th>
      <td>Browse and copy the public cert to ThoughtSpot.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

6. Click **Save** to configure the SSL.

You can now test the SSL setup by log in to the ThoughtSpot application. You should see the application URL begins with `https://`.



### Using tscli

Below are the instructions to install the SSL certificate using the tscli:

1. Follow the instructions from your certifying authority to obtain the certificate. This is usually sent by email or available for download.
2. Copy the certificate and key files to ThoughtSpot:

      ```
      $ scp <key> <certificate> admin@<IP_address>:<path>
      ```

3. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
4. Change directories to where you copied the certificate:

    ```
    $ cd <path>
    ```

5. Issue the `tscli` command to install the certificate:

    ```
    $ tscli ssl add-cert <key> <certificate>
    ```

6. To test that the certificate was installed correctly, [Log in to the ThoughtSpot application](logins.html#log-in-to-the-thoughtspot-application).

     You should see that the application's URL begins with `https://`.

#### Set the recommended TLS version

There are a couple of security vulnerabilities due to SSL certificates supporting older versions of TLS (Transport Layer Security). This procedure shows you how to set the recommended TLS version to avoid these vulnerabilities.

The PCI (Payment Card Industry) Data Security Standard and the FIPS 140-2 Standard require a minimum of TLS v1.1 and recommends TLS v1.2.

ThoughtSpot supports SSL v3, TLS v1.0, and TLS v1.1 for backwards compatibility. However, the recommended version is TLS v1.2. Therefore, to set the recommended TLS version:

1.  Enable your web browser to support TLS v1.2. This can be done in your browser's advanced settings.
2.  Log in to the Linux shell using SSH..
3.  Issue the following command:

    ```
    tscli ssl set-min-version 1.2
    ```

    This will block all usage of older versions.

#### Supported SSL ciphers
The types of SSL ciphers supported by webserver(s) in your ThoughtSpot instance can be listed by running the following command on any ThoughtSpot node (Not against the load-balancer).
    ```
    nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <ThoughtSpot_node_IP_address>
    ```
You must ensure that your load-balancer supports these ciphers.
