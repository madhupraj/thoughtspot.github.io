There are several configurations you can set up in your installation to ensure
your company's support from ThoughtSpot works smoothly.

## Set up a reverse tunnel for support

You can set up a reverse tunnel to allow ThoughtSpot Support to get access to
your ThoughtSpot instance, to perform support-related activities. This setup is
a much simpler, more secure, and scalable than the alternative option of using a
virtual meeting room.

Granting remote support access can streamline troubleshooting activities, since
it enables your support agent to work directly in a secure setting. The remote
tunnel enables SSH and HTTP access to your ThoughtSpot instance by ThoughtSpot Support.
This access can be granted and revoked easily, so you can enable it for a troubleshooting
session, and then disable it again. Before doing this procedure, make sure your
company's security policies allow reverse tunneling.

**_NOTE:_** Before you set up a reverse tunnel, open port `22`
in your firewall outgoing rules to whitelist `tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com`.

### Using Management Console
1. Log into ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click the **Admin** icon on the top navigation bar.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin.png)

   This opens the ThoughtSpot Management Console.
3. Click **Settings** icon on the top navigation bar.

5. Enter the reverse tunnel details:

      **image**

      <table>
      <colgroup>
      <col width="20%" />
      <col width="80%" />
      </colgroup>
      <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>Have you whitelisted tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com?</th>
      <td>Ensure that this has been done before you enable the SSH tunnel. Select <b> Yes </b> to continue.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>Reverse SSH Tunnel</th>
      <td>Select <b>Enable</b> to enable SSH and HTTP access to ThoughtSpot Support for troubleshooting.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

6. Click **Save** to configure the SSH tunnel.

You may choose to disable the access after ThoughtSpot Support finishes the troubleshooting.

### Using tscli
To enable remote support:

1. [Contact ThoughtSpot]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#) and open a support ticket for making the appropriate reverse tunnel settings on our end.
    Provide the cluster name of the cluster for which you want to enable remote support.
2. After the ticket is completed, continue with the remaining steps in this procedure to make the settings on your side.
3. Log into the Linux shell using SSH.
4. Issue the command to configure the destination for the remote tunnel.

    You only need to do this one time, when you are enabling the tunnel for the very
    first time. After that, this setting persists when you start and stop the
    remote tunnel.

    ```
    $ tscli support set-remote --addr tunnelrelay.thoughtspot.com --user ubuntu
    ```

5. Test that the setting is configured:

    ```
    $ tscli support show-remote
    ```

6. Enable the remote tunnel:

    ```
    $ tscli support start-remote
    ```

7. [Contact ThoughtSpot]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#) and test the setup with your ThoughtSpot Support contact.
8. After your remote session with ThoughtSpot Support is over, turn the remote tunnel off until you need to use it again:

    ```
    $ tscli support stop-remote
    ```

    You can repeat the steps to start and stop the remote tunnel as needed for future support operations.

9. Ensure that the remote tunnel is disabled:

    ```
    $ tscli support show-remote
    ```

## Configure a secure file server

ThoughtSpot Support uses a secure file server to provide new releases and to
receive logs and troubleshooting files that you upload. The secure server
connection is also required if you want to enable the optional statistics
collection using the call home feature.

Before you can upload a file to the secure file server, obtain your user name
and password for logging in to the secure file server. You can get these from
ThoughtSpot Support.

Configuring the connection to the file server is a one time operation. You do
not have to reconfigure the connection unless your password changes. Note that
you can do a one time override of the user and password you used to configure
the connection. This is done by passing a different user and password on the
command line when uploading or downloading a file.

To configure the connection to the secure file server:

1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
2. Issue the command to configure the file server:

    ```
    $ tscli fileserver configure --user <user_name> [--password <password>]
    ```

    If you do not supply the `--password` parameter, you are prompted to enter it.


## Call home with cluster usage data

"Call home" data is metadata and usage data from your ThoughtSpot cluster. This
data allows ThoughtSpot's Support team to troubleshoot your cluster. They use
the data to see basic usage information over time for your ThoughtSpot instance.
ThoughtSpot's "call home" functionality intermittently sends a call home bundle
of  statistics to a ThoughtSpot S3 server through HTTPS. The data is encrypted at
rest on the server.

By default, call home is enabled on your cluster. You can disable call home in
by doing the following:

1. Log into the ThoughtSpot server as `admin` user.
2. Use the `tscli` command to disable.

    ```
    $ tscli callhome disable
    ```

## Designate a support contact

A support contact person can answer questions for about data and searching at
your company. If the person can't answer a question that person should submit
system and software-related questions to ThoughtSpot Support. Your designated
support contact should have an available email and phone number.

To designate the custom support contact:

1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
2. Issue the `tscli` command to set the email address:

    ```
    $ tscli support set-admin-email <email_address>
    ```

3. Issue the `tscli` command to set the phone number:

    ```
    $ tscli support set-admin-phone <phone_number>
    ```

4. If you need to reset both of these to the default (ThoughtSpot Support), issue:

    ```
    $ tscli support rm-admin-email
    $ tscli support rm-admin-phone
    ```

## Manage the feedback contact

Users in ThoughtSpot may be asked for feedback for new or BETA features in the
system. By default, feedback goes directly to ThoughtSpot support.
Alternatively, you can send feedback to someone in your company, this is useful
if you are using ThoughtSpot embedded.

Your designated feedback contact should have an available email. To designate
the custom feedback contact, do the following:

1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
2. To set the feedback email address, do the following:

    ```
    $ tscli support set-feedback-email <email_address>
    ```
3. Verify the email address was set:

    ```
    $ tscli support show-feedback-email
    ```

If you need to reset the email to the default (ThoughtSpot support), issue:

```
$ tscli support rm-feedback-email
```

You can also choose not to send feedback out of your system at all by doing the
following:

```
$ tscli support set-feedback-email ' '
```

## How users find your company's support contact

After you set the custom support contact information, here's where your users
will see it:

-   In the Help Center, when a user selects **Contact Support**.

-   In error messages, when a user selects **What Happened?**
